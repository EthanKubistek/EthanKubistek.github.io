    <h1>My Education</h1>
    <section>
      <p>I graduated from Dallastown Area High School in 2019, My high school had tons of
        classes for different students. I focused on the tech related classes like robotics and electronics.
        But I found I also enjoyed woodworking. While doing robotics and electronics, I found out I like to write code.
        I also participated in duel enrollment at Stevens last year so I knew it was the college for me.
        Now I'm at Thaddues Stevens full time and my major is
        Computer Software Engineering Technology or CSET for short.</p>
