    <h1>My Education</h1>
    <section>
        <p>I graduated from Dallastown Area High School in 2019, My high school had tons of 
            classes for different students. I focused on the tech related classes like robotics and electronics. 
            But I found I also enjoyed woodworking. While doing robotics and electronics, I found out I like to write code. 
            I also participated in duel  enrollment at Stevens last year so I knew it was the college for me. 
            Now I'm at Thaddues Stevens full time and my major is 
            Computer Software Engineering Technology or CSET for short.</p>
